I am an experienced root biologist with expertise in plant mineral nutrition, plantâ€‘soil relations, and plant growth
under stress. I have worked and managed interdisciplinary teams of engineers, computational scientists, image analysts,
and biologists to try to build tools to allow us to effectively phenotype roots and identify genes that underlie
beneficial root traits. My skills include phenotyping, image analysis, field trial design and implementation, and R.
